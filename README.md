# Hugo Wolferton Data Analysis Tool

Data Analysis Tool report frontend. This is the webapp for my final year project at Loughborough University

This makes use of the API in [MattLicense/hugo-data-api](https://github.com/MattLicense/hugo-data-api) and uses the Google graphs API to display the data.

It's created using AngularJS.
